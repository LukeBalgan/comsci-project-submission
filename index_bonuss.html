				<h2>There is a Solution Among us.</h2>
				<p>Hi! I'm Luke. I'm a small man living in a small place, but with big goals and big ideas. I'm only just turning 15 but that won't stop me from dreaming. Maybe it's because I enrolled into Pisay. I don't know for sure. What I do know is that I like to mess around and see where that gets me. So I thought to myself, what problem can I solve for today? I thought to myself that I could solve overpopulation, but not in the waay I'd expect at first. I was considering cannibalism, but that would only lead to disease. I also tried a battle royale, but that wouldn't work either because it's too violent and hard to clean up. What else could I do?</p>
				<h2>That's when it hit me.</h2>
				<p>Of course! Why don't we just recreate one of the trending games of 2020, Among Us? It's fun, it's intense, and it's thrilling. And, most importantly, <em>it fixes our problem of overpopulation.</em> As a long-time player of this game I couldn't be prouder to use this as inspiration for my new idea. And so I wrote my essay and turned it in.</p>
				<h2>The problem</h2>
				<p>Now if there's one big problem with me it's that I procrastinate. <em>A lot.</em> I usually don't end up doing my work until the last few days they're due. Even this project is well overdue, about half a week. So I'm sorry if this is the case, but nonetheless, enjoy the content.</p>
